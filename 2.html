    <h1>BAGAN TEMPLES, PAGODAS AND MONASTRIES</h1>


    <h3>The ravages of time have reduced many of the structures to little more than rubble through the action of a millennium of erosion from wind, rain and the great power of the mighty Irrawaddy River cutting its path through the plain. That said, what
        currently remains undisturbed and what has been restored provides more than enough fascination for the visitor. There is contention about how the renovation of many of the structures has been carried out as many outside of the country believe
        the present state of disrepair should be prevented from getting worse and reconstruction should not take place while the local populace believe it is disrespectful to not repair damaged religious sites and re-instate worship at them. The most
        well-preserved and restored buildings are also the most revered, famous and therefore visited.</h3>
