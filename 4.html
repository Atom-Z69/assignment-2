    <h1>BAGAN HOTELS AND ACCOMMODATION</h1>
    <h3>There are now over 50 hotels in Bagan offering accommodation options to suit all visitors from budget through to luxury although typical prices in Bagan are slightly higher for the same quality of room compared to much of the rest of Myanmar. Many
        places offer individual bungalow-style accommodation and numerous places, even some in the budget range, have swimming pools which are a great way to cool off and relax after a busy day viewing the sights. At present expect a room or bungalow
        in a 4-star hotel to cost from around 80 USD a night, while a comfortable room in a 3-star hotel, but still with a swimming pool, costs from around 45 USD. At the other end of the scale a bed in a shared dormitory can be found for around 15 US
        Dollars a night or pay upwards of 30 USD for a twin room with en suite bathroom facilities.</h3>
